Hello! Thanks for stopping by :) I am a predoctoral researcher. I'm interested in doing research that increases the chance we can safely build and  deploy advanced AI systems that maximally benefit humanity. I am currently collaborating with Adrian Weller at the University of Cambridge on interpretability--in particular, we're extending concept bottleneck models. Before this, I worked on COVID-19 intervention effectiveness as a collaborator to Oxford's Applied and Theoretical ML group. Open Philanthropy supports my research. I did a master's in statistics at Oxford, and an undergrad in Maths at St Andrewsm a postgrad student in Statistics at the University of Oxford, currently writing my dissertation on adversarial robustness while participating in the Summer Research Fellowship at the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI), Oxford. Previously at Oxford, I carried out research on causal identifiability of agent-incentives with researchers at DeepMind and FHI. Before Oxford, I completed an undergrad in Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, interspersed with research internships in approximate Bayesian computation and deep Guassian processes, at Aalto University and Imperial College London, respectively.
